# jquery-imagefit

Fit an image tied & centered in his container.

## How to use

```
$('your-selector').imagefit()
```

## Protips

* The container parent has to be absolute or relative positioned.
* You have to run this when your image is fully loaded. You can use async loading or use the [imagesLoaded plugin](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded) to check.
